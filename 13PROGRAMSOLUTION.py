#Q1.)Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula:
# Q = Square root of [(2 * C * D)/H]
# Following are the fixed values of C and H:
# C is 50. H is 30.
# D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated
# sequence.
# Example
# Let us assume the following comma separated input sequence is given to the program:
# 100,150,180
# The output of the program should be:
# 18,22,24

items=[x for x in input().split(',')]
for d in items:
    value.append(str(int(round(math.sqrt(2*c*float(d)/h)))))

print(','.join(value))

#Q2.)Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array. The
# element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j.
# Note: i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1,Â¡Y-1.
# Example
# Suppose the following inputs are given to the program:
# 3,5
# Then, the output of the program should be:
# [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]]

#QUESTION 3.)  
# Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the
# words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# without,hello,bag,world
# Then, the output should be:
# bag,hello,without,world

#Q4.)Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as input and prints

# the words after removing all duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically.
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# hello world and practice makes perfect and hello world again
# Then, the output should be:
# again and hello makes perfect practice world
